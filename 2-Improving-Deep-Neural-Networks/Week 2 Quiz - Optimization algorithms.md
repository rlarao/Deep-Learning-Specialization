## Week 2 Quiz - Optimization algorithms

1. Which notation would you use to denote the 3rd layer’s activations when the input is the 7th example from the 8th minibatch?

    
2. Which of these statements about mini-batch gradient descent do you agree with?

    - [ ] You should implement mini-batch gradient descent without an explicit for-loop over different mini-batches, so that the algorithm processes all mini-batches at the same time (vectorization).
    - [ ] Training one epoch (one pass through the training set) using mini-batch gradient descent is faster than training one epoch using batch gradient descent.
    - [ ] One iteration of mini-batch gradient descent (computing on a single mini-batch) is faster than one iteration of batch gradient descent.
    
    
3. Why is the best mini-batch size usually not 1 and not m, but instead something in-between?

    
4. Suppose your learning algorithm’s cost ***J***, plotted as a function of the number of iterations, looks like this:

    
5. Suppose the temperature in Casablanca over the first three days of January are the same:

    Jan 1st: θ_1 = 10
    
    Jan 2nd: θ_2 * 10
    
    Say you use an exponentially weighted average with β = 0.5 to track the temperature: v_0 = 0, v_t = βv_t−1 + (1 − β)θ_t. If v_2 is the value computed after day 2 without bias correction, and v^corrected_2 is the value you compute with bias correction. What are these values?
    
    
6. Which of these is NOT a good learning rate decay scheme? Here, t is the epoch number.

    
7. You use an exponentially weighted average on the London temperature dataset. You use the following to track the temperature: v_t = βv_t−1 + (1 − β)θ_t. The red line below was computed using β = 0.9. What would happen to your red curve as you vary β? (Check the two that apply)

    
8. Consider this figure:

    These plots were generated with gradient descent; with gradient descent with momentum (β = 0.5) and gradient descent with momentum (β = 0.9). Which curve corresponds to which algorithm?


9. Suppose batch gradient descent in a deep network is taking excessively long to find a value of the parameters that achieves a small value for the cost function J(W[1],b[1],...,W[L],b[L]). Which of the following techniques could help find parameter values that attain a small value forJ? (Check all that apply)

    - [ ] Try using Adam
    - [ ] Try better random initialization for the weights
    - [ ] Try tuning the learning rate α
    - [ ] Try mini-batch gradient descent
    - [ ] Try initializing all the weights to zero

10. Which of the following statements about Adam is False?
